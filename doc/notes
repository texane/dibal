. pwm
 . encode an analog signal by the means of a serie of low / high pulses
  . duty cycle is the amount of time the signal is logical one
  . in practice, the modulating frequency must be high enough regarding
  the load response time (for instance, a light bulb switching on off during
  5 seconds is way too long)
  . to achieve such (relatively) high frequencies, pwm modules
  . lookup tables to associate between duty cycles and actual reactions

. pwm in pic18f4550
 . implemented by the ccp module
 . according to ccp mode, pwm used
 . duty cycle on 10 bits
 . 

. code
 . tasks
  . sensor, send message to decider
  . decider, takes a decision according to the current state
  . actuator: servo
  . advantage of the design
   . sensors can continue working while the decision takes place
   . decider can prepare a decision without waiting for the actuator to finish
    . is this necessary?


. todos
 . use pwm to drive servo
 . why is there a crash at ~20second usage
 . ultraound sensor code
 . noise sensor
 . light sensor
 . on/off button on the side
 . solar panel
 . sleep mode
 . think about power distribution
 . accoustic communication
